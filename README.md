# DFM: Distance from Mic 
## Speech to Text API Transcription API

## INTRODUCTION
Speech to Text API is a very powerful API. Here DFM will help analyze the accuracy of transcription for different speeches at varying distances. 

## TECHNOLOGIES
No extra installations required 
Use Voice Memo on phone to record and make sure to use a m4a to FLAC converter site to change the file format.

### DATA COLLECTION PROCESSES
For our set we chose 4 different distances (right next to the mic, 1 feet away, 3 feet away, and 6 feet away) and 3 different lines of varying lengths. We recommend using both different distances and different semantic lines for the analysis
