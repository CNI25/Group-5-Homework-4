# DFM: Distance from Mic 
**Speech to Text API Transcription Accuracy**

## INTRODUCTION
Speech to Text API is a very powerful google cloud machine learning API. Here DFM will help analyze the accuracy of transcriptions for different speeches at varying distances. 

## TECHNOLOGIES
No extra installations required. For data collection we used voice memo on our phones to record. 
Make sure to use a m4a to FLAC converter site to change to the correct file format, such as this site: https://cloudconvert.com/m4a-to-flac.
To run API, make sure to get your own API Key. 

### DATA COLLECTION PROCESSES
For our set we chose 4 different distances (right next to the mic, 1 feet away, 3 feet away, and 6 feet away) and 3 different lines of varying lengths. We recommend using both different distances and different semantic lines for the analysis.
